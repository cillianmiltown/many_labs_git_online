COVID-­19 Mitigation Measures
We assessed three types of mitigation measures: support for restrictions (henceforth restrictions sup-
port), adherence to physical distancing measures (henceforth distancing adherence), and adherence to
Moral Identity and COVID-­19

physical hygiene measures (henceforth hygiene adherence). All items were rated on a slider scale, ranging
from 0 = strongly disagree to 100 = strongly agree, with 11 anchors (0, 10, 20, etc.); thus, higher scores
indicate stronger support and greater adherence (full wordings of all items are in the online appendix).
Restrictions support Five items assessed support for policy restrictions (e.g., “In favor of closing
all bars and restaurants”; Cronbach’s α: total sample: .91, USA: .91, New Zealand: .88).
Distancing adherence Five items assessed adherence to physical distancing measures (e.g.,
“Keeping physical distance from all other people outside my home”; Cronbach’s α: total sample:
.77, USA: .76, New Zealand: .77).
Hygiene adherence Five items assessed adherence to physical hygiene guidelines (e.g., “Washing
my hands immediately after returning home”; Cronbach’s α: total sample: .85, USA: .87, New
Zealand: .80).
Moral Identity
The 10-­item Moral Identity Scale (Aquino & Reed, 2002) was employed. Five items assessed
symbolization (e.g., “I am actively involved in activities that communicate to others that I have these
characteristics”; Cronbach’s α: total sample: .835, USA: .84, New Zealand: .80), and five items
assessed internalization (e.g., “Being someone who has these characteristics is an important part of
who I am”; Cronbach’s α: total sample: .73, USA: .73, New Zealand: .77). Responses were recorded
on an 11-­point scale ranging from 0 = strongly disagree to 10 = strongly agree; negative items were
reverse-­coded such that higher scores indicated higher moral identity.
Political Ideology
We measured participants’ political ideology using a left–­right self-­placement item (“Overall,
how would you describe yourself in terms of political ideology?”), where participants indicated their
orientation as ranging from 0 = Extremely liberal/left leaning to 10 = Extremely conservative/very
right leaning. This widely used measure is generally stable (Krosnick, 1991) and predicts various
social attitudes (Dunn, 2011).
Covariates
Moral circle The moral circle task (Waytz et al., 2019) was employed, whereby participants indicate
how far their moral circle in general extends (i.e., categories for whom a person is concerned about
right and wrong done to them) by selecting 1 of 16 statements ranging from your immediate family
to all things in existence. Moral circle is thus scored from 1 to 16, where larger numbers represent a
larger moral circle (see the online appendix for full wording).
Risk perception COVID-­19 risk perception was assessed by two items: “By April 30, 2021: How
likely do you think it is that you will get infected by the Coronavirus (Covid-­19)?” and “By April 30,
2021: How likely do you think it is that the average person in [your country] will get infected by the
Coronavirus (COVID-­19)?” Each item was rated from 0% = impossible to 100% = certain. Higher
scores represent higher perceived risk (Cronbach’s α: total sample: .84, USA: .82, New Zealand: .87).
Individual narcissism The six-­
 item Brief Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire
(NARQ; Back et al., 2013) assessed two dimensions of narcissism: admiration (e.g., “I deserve to be

 McHugh et al.
seen as a great personality”; Cronbach’s α: combined sample: .83, USA: .83, New Zealand: .79) and
rivalry (e.g., “Most people are somehow losers”; Cronbach’s α: total sample: .81, USA: .83, New
Zealand: .73). Responses were recorded on an 11-­point scale ranging from 0 = strongly disagree to
10 = strongly agree, with higher scores representing higher admiration and rivalry.
Collective narcissism Collective narcissism was assessed using a three-­item scale (Golec de Zavala
et al., 2009; e.g., “[My national group] deserves special treatment”). Responses were recorded on
an 11-­point scale ranging from 0 = strongly disagree to 10 = strongly agree. Higher scores represent
greater collective narcissism (Cronbach’s α: total sample: .85, USA: .86, New Zealand: .80).
Conspiracy beliefs Four items assessed COVID-­19 conspiracy beliefs (e.g., “The coronavirus
(COVID-­19) is a bioweapon engineered by scientists.” Participants rated each item from 0 = strongly
disagree to 10 = strongly agree. Higher scores represent stronger conspiracy beliefs (Cronbach’s α:
total sample: .92, USA: .92, New Zealand: .92).
National identification Two items assessed national identification (“I identify as [nationality]”;
Postmes et al., 2013; “Being a [nationality] is an important reflection of who I am”; Leach et
al., 2008). Responses were recorded on an 11-­item scale ranging from 0 = strongly disagree to
10 = strongly agree (Cronbach’s α: total sample: .77, USA: .76, New Zealand: .80). Higher scores
indicate higher levels of national identification.
